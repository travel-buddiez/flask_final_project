The holiday is marked with fireworks and parades featuring dancers dressed as dragons.",

         "India": "Diwali is the largest and most important holiday to India, according to National Geographic. It is a five-day festival known as the festival of lights because of the lights lit during the celebration to symbolize the inner light that protects them from spiritual darkness.",

         "South Korea": "In South Korea names operate in the reverse of Western cultures; Family name (surname), a second family name shared by all of that generation, and finally their given name. It is considered very impolite to address a Korean with his or her given name. They should be addressed using their professional titles, or Mr, Mrs Etc, until permission is given otherwise."},

    {"Customs":
        {"Customs": "Almost certainly the most widespread 'custom' in Antarctica is the Polar Plunge it revolves around being scarily cold, but only briefly. The seas around Antarctica vary from about 28.4F to 35.6F throughout the year, at 28.4F the sea freezes, the salt content makes this happen below 32F, so Antarctic sea water is often as cold as it is possible for water to get, especially in the winter months. Jumping in the sea wearing swimming attire is a surprisingly popular thing to do. Originally something that was done by members of scientific bases particularly at Midwinter or Christmas, this has spread across the continent and now happens far more often as shorter term visitors in the summer want to have a go too."}

        {"Egypt": "Egypt is a country full of mystery, which attracts numerous tourists. It’s an Arab Muslim country and the Egyptians tend to be very conservative with their own unique living habits, especially in rural areas. You will have to respect and comply with Muslim customs and traditions when traveling in Egypt. Do not wear sleeveless tops and short skirts or shorts on the streets or in markets. Do not eat communal food with your left hand, Do not offer alcohol or pork, Do not touch during a conversation",

         "South Africa": "It’s impolite to point with your index finger so use an open hand. Talking with your hands in your pockets is considered rude. When passing through a doorway, it’s customary for men to precede women. Don’t initiate or participate in racist or sexist conversations should the topic arise. The 'V' or peace sign is the same as giving 'someone the finger', and it’s usually punctuated by an upward thrust of the hand"},

    {"Customs":
        {"Egypt": "Those who want wealth and prosperity to come to their house, bury a weasel at the doorstep. Egyptians believe that burying a weasel at their doorstep will allow them to gain a lot of money and have a better life.",

         "Nigeria": "The most common greeting is a handshake with a warm, welcoming smile. Men may place their left hand on the other person’s shoulder while shaking hands. Smiling and showing sincere pleasure at meeting the person is important. As in the rest of Africa, it is rude to rush the greeting process. You must take the time to ask about the person’s health, the health of their family, or other social niceties. A Nigerian generally waits for the woman to extend her hand. Address people initially by their academic, professional or honorific title and their surname. Always wait until invited before using someone’s first name. When greeting someone who is obviously much older, it is a sign of respect and deference to bow the head.",

         "South Africa": "There are several greeting styles in South Africa depending upon the ethnic heritage of the person you are meeting. When dealing with foreigners, most South Africans shake hands while maintaining eye contact and smiling. Some women do not shake hands and merely nod their head, so it is best to wait for a woman to extend her hand. Men may kiss a woman they know well on the cheek in place of a handshake. Greetings are leisurely and include time for social discussion and exchanging pleasantries."},

        {"Spain": "Spain is famous around the world for Flamenco music and dance, bullfights, fantastic beaches, and lots of sunshine.",

         "Finland": "Finland is an easy country to visit. Finnish customs and manners are clearly European, with only a few national variations, and attitudes are liberal. There is very little chance of a visitor committing fundamental social gaffes or breaches of etiquette that would fatally damage relations between himself and his hosts. Such breaches are viewed by Finns with equanimity if committed by their own countrymen and with understanding or amusement if committed by foreigners. Codes of behavior are fairly relaxed, and reputations – good or bad – are built up over time as the result of personal actions rather than conforming to norms or standards. It is difficult in Finland to make or break a reputation with a single social blunder.",

         "Bosnia and Herzegovina": "Bosnians are known as a friendly, hospitable people. In Muslim houses, it is traditional to remove one's shoes and put on a pair of slippers. Kissing is a common form of greeting for both men and women. Three kisses on alternating cheeks are customary. Visiting is a common pastime. When entering a home as a guest, one often brings a small present. Hosts are expected to serve a meal or refreshment."},

     {"Taboos": "Avoid criticizing or joking about Australia, its culture and traditions, or other Australians, even if your Australian companions are doing so. Don’t discuss the ethnic relations as it relates to the history of the Aborigines. Avoid talking too much about your education, professional experience, business success, and related achievements as it may be considered a boosting. Australians are often distrustful of authority and of people who think that they are somehow “better” than others. Remain modest in conversation. If you are invited out for a drink, don’t bring up the subject of business unless your host does so first."},

    {"Customs":

    {"Continent": "North America"},
    {"Taboos":
        {"The United States of America": "Until you know a person well, avoid discussing religion, politics or other controversial subjects (abortion, racism, sexism etc.). Also avoid all race, gender, ethnic or religious jokes. For the most part, Americans aren’t prone to touching, hugging, or kissing when greeting, or during business conversations and social situations. While it’s common to point with the index finger, it’s impolite to point at another person. Refrain from asking women if they are married. If a woman volunteers this information, you may ask a few polite questions about her husband or children. Smoking is not as commonplace and is subject to restrictions in most public places. Even where smoking is allowed, always ask if those you are with will mind if you smoke.",

         "Canada": "Making comparisons that emphasizes any inferiority or similarity to the U.S. Quebec separatism or other possible conflicts between French and English Canada. Comparisons between the Canadian and US Health Care Systems or medical insurance. Any inferiority of the Canadian dollar in comparison to the US dollar. Religion in general, although Canada is very tolerant of most religions.",

         "Mexico": "The “O.K.” gesture with the thumb and index finger is considered vulgar. Men should avoid putting their hands in their pockets as this is considered rude. Religious profanity is very offensive in Mexico. Putting your hands on your hips signifies that you’re making a challenge. Eye contact is less direct, so avoid looking at others too intently."},
     },
    {"Customs":
        {"The United States of America": "Being on time is very important. Americans like privacy and personal space. Americans can be very direct and honest, even though it may seem rude to people from another culture. Americans ask about how your day is going without expecting an answer. Americans wait their turn in lines. Americans value independent thinking. Americans like to joke, smile and talk. Americans are very concerned with personal hygiene and cleanliness. It is not unusual for them to bathe one or even two times a day.",

         "Canada": "Most common form of greeting is by handshakes; handshakes should be firm and accompanied with a sincere smile. Eye contact is very important; a lack of eye contact signifies shyness, disinterest, insecurity, boredom, or low confidence. Address Canadians by their professional title or Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms and surname; wait for invitation to use their first name. Pleasantries are exchanged very quickly upon first encounters. When greeting French Canadians, lightly kiss on the cheeks (once to the left cheek and once to the right cheek); in Quebec and other French speaking parts of Canada, always use the formal 'vous' instead of 'tu' as it demonstrates respect",

         "Mexico": "Mexicans are largely sociable, friendly and warm, and expect a minimum of a handshake when meeting. Two women may kiss on one cheek, and two men may hug instead in social settings. About an arm’s distance of personal space is respected, but do not be alarmed by an affectionate touch on the shoulder or arm during conversation, as this indicates a relationship has been established, and can be reciprocated in kind. The most positive interactions with Mexicans may come from discussions about their family and friends, so do not be afraid to ask about where they come from, what the typical food is there, what are the places of interest and so on, and be able to offer the same about your family and background. Offer compliments about the weather, food and the people you have met, as well as what you plan on doing during your time in their country. Do not be surprised if they talk openly and frankly about emotions, family and personal issues. Mexicans do not tend to speak so much with their hands as may be seen in Spain or Italy, and do not tend to make much eye contact – this is a sign of respect."},

    {"Continent": "South America"},
    {"Taboos":
        {"Brazil": "Brazilians tend to be reticent about discussing their private lives and those of others. Avoid asking too many personal questions, particularly those regarding family, income and status in the workplace. Be aware that Brazilians do not perceive themselves as Hispanics and may take offense if addressed in Spanish. It’s important to maintain steady eye contact because its considered rude to break eye contact in the middle of a conversation. Brazilians use many gestures, however the “OK” sign (using your first finger and thumb to form a circle) is considered vulgar so avoid using it. Use your whole hand when you feel the need to point at something since using the forefinger may be considered rude. Changing your business negotiation team in the middle of the cycle can also jeopardize the entire negotiation process and is a major breach of Brazilian business protocol.",

         "Bolivia": "Bolivians don’t have the same concept of personal space as in other countries. Typically people will stand very closely to you and if you back away will think you are being rude or that you’ve been offended by something they’ve said. Bolivians also touch and gesture much more than in other countries. While they’re talking to you they may pat you on the back, touch your arm, or lean toward you. Bolivians typically speak softly and are bothered when a uniform degree of sound is not maintained. When in public, on a bus, in a restaurant, etc. you should take your cue from those around you in terms of how loudly you can speak or laugh. In general, try not to stand out above the rest in volume or when you laugh or gesture. On the other hand, in some situations, such as as bars or discoteques, Bolivians can be very loud and racocious. When greeting, it is customary to shake hands with your right hand. In social situations, not so much with business introductions, when you are introduced to someone or are greeting someone you are also expected to lean to your left as you clasp their hand and kiss them on the cheek. Women kiss women and men kiss women, but men do not kiss men. Maintain eye contact at all times. Looking away or around while you talk to someone or while they talk to you is considered rude and gives the other person the impression that what they are saying is not important to you. If you are seated when someone comes over to greet you, stand up for the greeting. Don’t make people lean down toward you. If a woman enters the room, stand up and don’t sit down again until she does. It is customary for men to offer their seats to women and the elderly, but not to children. Children are expected to sit on their parents’ laps or on the floor next to them if there are not empty seats for them. Never sit on the arm of a chair. Never put your feet up on anyone’s furniture. Never take your shoes off at anyone’s home unless they invite you to do so, or unless you plan to swim in their pool. When someone enters your house you should immediately offer to take their coat. Draping your coat over someone’s furniture is not good social etiquette. Preferably, if they don’t offer to take your coat, keep it on your lap or hold it until they realize they’ve forgotten to take your coat. If you visit someone’s house, it is not good social etiquette to enter their bedroom. If they give you a tour of the house, only enter the bedrooms if invited to do so. Otherwise, just peek into the room from the doorway. Always introduce people using their professional titles along with their names, and always begin with the formal form of YOU, which in Spanish is USTED. Do not switch to the informal form (TÚ) until they do so first. Be aware of your posture. Sitting in a slumped position is considered rude. Never wear wrinkled, ripped or messy clothing in public. Be aware that smoking indoors is not against the law in Bolivia and people quite often smoke in restaurants, bars, discos, etc.. Asking them not to smoke is considered rude and imposing. It is rude to stare and even more rude to point. When you want to point out someone or something, typically you nod your head in their (or its) direction. Women are considered subordinate to men in many places of Bolivia. If you are sitting between or beside people, never turn your back on someone in order to pay attention to what another is saying. It is considered very bad social etiquette, even a snub if you will to “dar la espalda” (turn your back on someone). If it is absolutely necessary for some reason, before you turn your back on someone you should say “Disculpe si le doy la espalda un momento” (“Forgive me for turning my back on you for a moment”). This will let them know you are aware of them, are not snubbing them, and have no intention of being rude.",

         "Columbia": "Avoid mentioning anything about drug traffic or illegal cartels. Don’t make negative remarks about bullfighting. Avoid talking about differences between the Columbian culture and yours. Avoid any discussion around terrorism, politics and religion. Avoid making complaints of any kind."},
     },
    {"Customs":
        {"Brazil": "“Flexible punctuality” is characteristic of Brazilian business culture. You will have to accept that waiting for your Brazilian counterparts will be part of doing business here. Dance is an essential part of Brazilian identity. From bossa nova to forró to samba, Brazilians love of dance can’t be denied. Football (or soccer, whichever one you prefer) is an essential aspect of Brazilian culture and identity. When the Brazilian team plays, the country unites and celebrates passionately.",

         "Bolivia": "The handshake is the most common form of greeting. Direct eye contact is also usual. When meeting people will use the most appropriate greeting for the time of day - these are 'buenos dias' (good morning), 'buenas tardes' (good day), or 'buenas noches'(good evening). People with an informal relationship will be warmer and embrace or pat each other on the shoulder. Women will kiss on the cheek. Unlike Europeans Bolivians use both their maternal and paternal surnames. The father's surname is listed first and is the one used in conversation. When a woman gets married she usually adds her husband's first surname to her first surname with the connector 'de', so if Jennifer Maria Lopez marries Manuel Sebastien Costa, she would be called Jennifer Maria de Costa. If you know of someone's title always use it.",

         "Columbia": "Men shake hands with direct eye contact. While shaking hands, use the appropriate greeting for the time of day: 'buenos dias' (good day), 'buenas tardes' (good afternoon), or 'buenas noches' (good evening/night). Women often grasp forearms rather than shaking hands. Once a friendship has developed, greetings become warmer and a lot more hands on - men will embrace and pat each other on the shoulder (known as an 'abrazo') and women kiss once on the right cheek. Most Colombians have both a maternal and paternal surname and will use both. The father's surname is listed first and is the one used in conversation. Always refer to people by the appropriate honorific title and their surname."},
